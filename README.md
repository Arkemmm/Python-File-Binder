# 100% Python file binder  
## Current status : The output file is broken because it only executes one input file. Please help me to resolve this problem.  


File Binder is a Python script that allows you to bind multiple files together into a single output file.  
The script is written in PyQt6 and uses a graphical user interface (GUI) to make it easy to use.  

## Features  
➤  Binds multiple files into a single output file  
➤  Supports executable files (.exe) and batch files (.bat)  
➤  Displays a progress bar during the binding process  
➤  Displays a message box when the binding process is complete  


## Usage  

1. To use File Binder, first open the script in a Python IDE or Visual Studio Code.  
2. In the GUI, click the "Select Files" button to select the files that you want to bind.  
3. In the GUI, enter the path to the output file in the "Output File" field.  
4. Click the "Bind" button to start the binding process.  


## Requirements  

  ➤ Python 3.9 or later  
  ➤ PyQt6  
  

## Installation

pip install PyQt6  
```
After you can launch the script using Visual Studio Code for example.
